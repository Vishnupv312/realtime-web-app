## Test Coverage

### Functionality Tested

1. **Local Video Camera Off**
   - Placeholder rendering
   - Track state management (enabled/disabled)
   - Audio preservation during video disable
   - UI feedback (avatar, icons)

2. **Local Video Camera On**
   - Video feed restoration
   - Track reference stability
   - Stream attachment to video element
   - State synchronization

3. **Remote Video Camera Off**
   - Remote state detection
   - Event listener functionality (mute/unmute)
   - Placeholder rendering for remote user
   - UI updates based on remote track state

4. **Remote Video Camera On**
   - Video feed restoration from remote
   - Stream reference maintenance
   - Event-driven state updates
   - UI reflection of remote video state

5. **Rapid Toggling Scenarios**
   - Multiple consecutive toggles (10-20 times)
   - Toggles with delays
   - Alternating local/remote toggles
   - Peer connection stability
   - Track reference stability
   - Prevention of duplicate track creation

## Key Implementation Details

### Mock Setup
- **MockMediaStreamTrack**: Complete implementation with event listeners
- **MockMediaStream**: Full track management
- **RTCPeerConnection**: Mocked with all required methods
- **MediaUtils**: Mocked getUserMedia and device info
- **Socket Service**: Mocked for WebRTC signaling

### Testing Approach
1. **Hook-level tests**: Focus on WebRTC state management and logic
2. **Component-level tests**: Focus on UI rendering and user interactions
3. **Integration approach**: Tests simulate real-world scenarios including:
   - Event dispatching
   - State polling (VideoCallModal polls every 200ms)
   - Asynchronous state updates
   - Re-rendering cycles

### Edge Cases Covered
- Null stream handling
- Rapid state changes
- Event listener lifecycle
- Track state vs. muted state differences
- Audio/video decoupling
- Component unmount during active calls

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all video toggle tests
npm test -- video-toggle.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm test -- video-toggle.test.tsx --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- useWebRTC.video-toggle.test.tsx
npm test -- VideoCallModal.video-toggle.test.tsx
```

## Test Results

```
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       30 passed, 30 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        ~3-4 seconds
```

## Benefits

1. **Confidence**: Ensures video toggle functionality works correctly
2. **Regression Prevention**: Catches breaking changes early
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
4. **Refactoring Safety**: Enables safe code refactoring
5. **Edge Case Coverage**: Tests uncommon but important scenarios
6. **Integration Validation**: Confirms hook and component integration

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for additional test coverage:
- Network failure scenarios during toggle
- Browser permission denial handling
- Multiple simultaneous peer connections
- Screen sharing toggle integration
- Mobile-specific scenarios
- Performance benchmarking for rapid toggles
