# Call Disconnection Test Guide

## ✅ Implementation Summary

The following has been implemented for proper call disconnection handling:

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **Socket Service Updates** (`lib/socket.ts`)
- Added `sendCallEnd()` method
- Added `sendCallReject()` method
- These send `webrtc:call-end` and `webrtc:call-reject` events to the backend

#### 2. **WebRTC Hook Updates** (`hooks/useWebRTC.ts`)
- Added socket listeners for `webrtc:call-end` and `webrtc:call-reject`
- Updated `endCall(isRemoteEnd)` method to send signal only when locally ending call
- Added `handleReceiveCallEnd()` for when remote user ends call
- Added `handleReceiveCallReject()` for when remote user rejects call
- Enhanced cleanup function with proper stream and peer connection disposal
- Added socket listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks

#### 3. **Call Log Integration**
- Both users see "✅ Video call ended – [duration]" when call ends
- Proper duration tracking and logging
- Missed call logging when call is rejected

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Normal Call End by Caller
1. User A starts video call to User B
2. User B accepts the call
3. Both users see video streams
4. **User A clicks "End Call"**

**Expected Results:**
- User A immediately disconnects and sees "✅ Video call ended – [duration]" log
- User B automatically disconnects and sees "✅ Video call ended – [duration]" log
- Both peer connections and streams are properly cleaned up
- No memory leaks

### Test 2: Normal Call End by Callee  
1. User A starts video call to User B
2. User B accepts the call
3. Both users see video streams
4. **User B clicks "End Call"**

**Expected Results:**
- User B immediately disconnects and sees "✅ Video call ended – [duration]" log
- User A automatically disconnects and sees "✅ Video call ended – [duration]" log
- Both peer connections and streams are properly cleaned up

### Test 3: Call Rejection
1. User A starts video call to User B
2. **User B clicks "Reject" (or doesn't answer)**

**Expected Results:**
- User B sees "❌ Missed video call – [time]" log
- User A sees "❌ Missed video call – [time]" log
- Both users' call states reset to idle
- No active peer connections remain

### Test 4: Connection Failure
1. User A starts video call to User B
2. User B accepts the call
3. Network connection is interrupted

**Expected Results:**
- Both users automatically disconnect
- Both users see "✅ Video call ended – [duration]" log
- Proper cleanup occurs on both ends

## 🔧 Backend Requirements

**Note**: Your backend needs to handle these new events:

```javascript
// Backend should relay these events between users
socket.on('webrtc:call-end', (data) => {
  // Forward to the other user in the room
  socket.to(roomId).emit('webrtc:call-end');
});

socket.on('webrtc:call-reject', (data) => {
  // Forward to the caller
  socket.to(roomId).emit('webrtc:call-reject');
});
```

## 🚀 Testing Instructions

1. **Open two browser windows** (or use different devices)
2. **Log in with different users** in each window
3. **Start a chat connection** between the two users
4. **Run through each test scenario above**
5. **Check browser console** for proper cleanup logs
6. **Verify chat logs** show correct call end messages
7. **Check for memory leaks** using browser dev tools

## 🔍 Debugging

If issues occur, check:

1. **Console logs**: Look for WebRTC cleanup messages
2. **Network tab**: Verify socket events are being sent/received
3. **Memory tab**: Check for lingering MediaStream objects
4. **Backend logs**: Ensure call-end events are being relayed

## 🎯 Key Benefits

- **Automatic disconnection**: When one user ends call, other user immediately disconnects
- **Proper logging**: Both users see consistent call end logs with duration
- **Memory management**: All streams and peer connections are properly cleaned up  
- **No double signaling**: Prevents duplicate call-end events
- **Graceful failures**: Network issues are handled cleanly
